# <Challenge-5-Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

With this challenge I greated a password generator using java script. I achieved this by implimenting button, checkmark, and number input html attributes, which subsequently allowed me to change the result of the password generated once selecting my desired criteria. For the actual generation of the password I used for loops, if statements, and functions to achieve my desired random number generation. From completing this assignment I learned the utility of math.random along with gaining a deeper understanding for for loops after trooblshooting several issues that persisted initally through my algorithm.

With this challenge, I used jQuery to create a responsive day scheduler page. I was able to achieve this final result by creating several input forms in which values were stored locally through local storage saving. The multiple functions of the page were organized neatly through the use of several functions and loops which helped keep track of what each line of code functionally accomplished. The front-end assets of the page were created using google font elements, Bootstrap, and a few simple CSS elements. Completing this assignment allowed me to be more comfortable with jQuery utility and java script concepts as a whole. Additionally, I learned how effective console logging was in debugging problems with javascript, and overall felt more comfortable with the concept of coding upon the completion of this page.
